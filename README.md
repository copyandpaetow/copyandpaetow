I like UI work and everything that moves in the browser. I usually try to be activly lazy with my projects, where I spend a lot of time not having to spend more time in the future. This is why I am currently looking into web-components.
It's also a good reason to procrastinate learning rust. 

more about me: 

- I like the cascade in CSS 
- I care about on-screen performance
- I know enough about a11y to know how little I know
- I chuckle about quotes like "why use 2 lines of CSS when you can use 150 lines of react"
